**Biography**

<p>I am currently a Research Scientist at <a href="www.tid.es">Telefonica Research</a>. My research focuses on understanding the Web&#39;s threat landscape, sheding light in the digital ad ecosystem  and developing countermeasures and privacy-preserving techniques for better protecting users.</p>
<p>Before that, I was the Security Researcher of <a href="http://www.brave.com">Brave Software Inc</a>. and my role was to lead the security and fraud related research and development of the Brave Browser and Brave Ads.</p>
<p>I received my B.Sc. (2011), M.Sc.
