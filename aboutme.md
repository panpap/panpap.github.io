I am currently a Research Scientist at [Telefonica Research](www.tid.es). My research focuses on understanding the Web's threat landscape, sheding light in the digital ad ecosystem  and developing countermeasures and privacy-preserving techniques for better protecting users.

Before that, I was the Security Researcher of [Brave Software Inc](http://www.brave.com). and my role was to lead the security and fraud related research and development of the Brave Browser and Brave Ads.

I received my B.Sc. (2011), M.Sc. (2014), and Ph.D. (2018) degrees in Computer Science from the University of Crete (Greece) while working as an Assistant Researcher in the [Distributed Computing Systems Lab](https://www.ics.forth.gr/discs/) at [FORTH](https://www.forth.gr/).
